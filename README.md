===============

One thing I miss about textmate is ⌘R and ⌥⌘R. 

The former would run the current script and display output in a separate
window. The latter would run selected code (or the current line).

This simple plugin aims to mimic that, except **1)** you won't need to save to
use it (great for quick tests), **2)** expand commands into output in-buffer
and **3)** ... who knows? It's a small mod with big dreams!

It works out of the box with PHP, Ruby, Python and sh script (interpreted
languages).
